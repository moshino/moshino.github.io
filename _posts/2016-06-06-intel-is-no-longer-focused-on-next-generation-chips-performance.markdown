If Yes, provide what you want the next generation PC processor performance or energy efficiency? To be honest, for those who are in the field of turn off computer enthusiasts, more performance, lower power consumption or longer battery life between these topics, often for interesting discussions and debates, and from Intel and AMD that competitive era has already begun.　　Today, AMD is clearly not in the rhythm, so fans the most discussed is Intel processor development, and represents the future of desktop PC chip bellwether. However, there is no external competitive pressures, Intel seems to be difficult to make faster progress, the most obvious sign is that its 14-nanometer chips had broken the \"tick\" law extended for three years the time to rest on our laurels. Then, hopes of 10 nm and 7 NM Intel chips do?[![Alt Victorias Secret iPhone 6+ case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6plus/victorias_secret_i6p1103_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/victoria-s-secret-pink-iphone-6-plus-case-letters-rose-p-4393.html)　　Held in New York on Wednesday at a meeting of strategic decisions, Intel Chief Executive Officer bulaien·keziannike (Brian Krzanich) that Intel hopes to be released based on the 10 nm and 7 nm process each generation of chips can provide a stable 10% to 20% performance.　　Many PC enthusiasts expressed disappointment about this, because in their opinion these numbers should be incremented, or Zen to be released AMD next generation processor architecture can so remarkable about it? AMD at Computex 2016 days ago once again confirmed that ZEN framework has brought about great improvements in terms of performance, as opposed to the \"bulldozer\" schema on each clock instruction set implementation rate rose more than 40%.　　AMD make·Pei Cooper, Chief Technology Officer at that time masters (Mark Papermaster) that ZEN is unprecedented in history, a large performance increase. AMD Chief Executive Su Da MOM Lisa Su said when he took over this, ZEN highlights of processor architecture is \"high performance\".　　New direction: energy efficiency and to cut costs?　　Today\'s Intel, and AMD seem to have different goals, not only focus on laptops use battery life, and we hope that the PC be able to get higher performance at more affordable prices. Simply put, Intel\'s top priority is to make chips become smaller, while significantly reducing power consumption and manufacturing costs.　　New York meeting, bulaien·keziannike said: \"it is to me, I bring the Intel quest each transistor cost and performance per watt can provide, this is the real way, I believe, and will continue to do so. ” [Victorias Secret iPhone 6+ case](http://www.nodcase.com/victoria-s-secret-pink-iphone-6-plus-case-letters-rose-p-4393.html) [Victorias Secret](http://247wallst.com/retail/2016/02/29/q4-retail-sales-sag-on-poor-showing-from-wal-mart-february-sales-up-slightly/)　　It is clear that Intel is sought by means of different direction to lead, but it did help to achieve a balance between cost and performance per watt, at least bulaien·keziannike that these changes can keep Intel in chip manufacturing, a leading opponent.　　Intel has long made chips, and AMD is different, currently by chipmaker Globalfoundries to manufacturing, some also to Intel\'s rivals, including Samsung and TSMC.　　\"If you know anything about the other competitors, know what they say 10 nm for performance improvement is small, they would choose 7 nm to improve performance. And our plan in these technology nodes, each generation can 10% to 20% more consistent performance improvement. \"Krzanich gives said.　　Since 40 years, Intel has followed Moore\'s law as a guide to transistor development, its core ideas as a technological innovation. According to Moore\'s law, the number of transistors on integrated power 1 time every two years, and lower costs. But now more and more difficult to maintain, the strategy appears stalled, to design the chips more economical, hoping more advanced PC technology, while ensuring that costs more affordable.　　Accurate to say, Intel seems to have started to consider new strategies that promote a technology process for three years, instead of every two years. But note that the fact that technological progress closer to the physical limits of semiconductor Silicon 10nm, making more difficult, the costs and risks are higher, Intel is now considering on the billions of dollars invested in the new plant, so spend more time is also reasonable.　　Of course, Intel has confirmed that the first 10 nanometer chip called Cannonlake, will release later in 2017.![Alt Intel is no longer focused on next-generation chips performance?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7340/27465555766_bffeb5443b_b.jpg)　　Technology process isn\'t important? 　　Tirias Research Chief Analyst jimu·maigeleige (Jim McGregor), Intel bosses hold different views on the performance improvements in chip. He said Intel had said \"rival technology performance improvements will not much progress\" on the right, but with the maturity of the technology process performance also improved significantly, only on the basis of advanced technology to support could stimulate the growth of the performance.　　If proved, can do it directly with Intel\'s example. Originally Intel had just stepped into the 14-nanometer technology, performance and 22 nm, but as the technology matures, now 14-nanometer chip performance has been further uplifted. On the development of technology processes, Intel\'s competitors are struggling to pass, no surprise Samsung has the potential to be the first manufacturer that can be put into operation 10 nm, but TSMC said mass production in 10-nanometer chips by the end of this year.　　However, every time chip technology process, performance will be steady circulation growth? Who maybe, possibly this ZEN architecture in 40% after upgrade can\'t do it? After all this time AMD ZEN new schema upgrade is not just 14-nm process as simple, accompanied by improvement of complex 3D transistor structure, these are long-term AMD not fundamentally improve key projects.　　In addition, in order to gain a performance advantage 7-nanometer process nodes, most chip manufacturers are betting more advanced manufacturing techniques, such as EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) technology, which helps to eliminate the complex problems of the chip manufacturing process, to create a chip more sophisticated. Intel say 7 nanometers is a major upgrade, process description the process is still a big challenge for all major manufacturers.　　In terms of chip technology process, Intel has for many years ahead, unforgettable time and time again there are so many breakthroughs, such as the 2007 made a transistor gate dielectric high-k material, which is the biggest change in transistor technology since 1960, claims to ensure that Moore is extending its 10-year, and 2011 3D transistors Intel brilliance into the 22 nanometer era.　　In short, Intel also focused on the development of the semiconductor industry as a whole, believe Intel has its own technology once again, in order to ensure that in the process process leads. Bulaien·keziannike at last week\'s meeting also said that \"at least two process nodes, we know how to stay ahead.\"[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags:PC and hardwareIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
